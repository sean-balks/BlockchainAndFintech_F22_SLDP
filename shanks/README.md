# Queries
This directory is a testing directory to write some useful dune analytics sql queries that may be used
to find common data regarding nfts, eth and trade volumes. 


# Pre-Post Merge Data
In order to analyze the effects of the ethereum pre/post merge, we should attempt to query for data 
before and after the date of the merge, which is September 15th 2022 to analyze trends. 

# ETH Participation Rate
This query will pull data on the number of attestations on ETH before and after the merge. Participation rate data can allow us to gain insights on the finalization times for transactions added to the chain.
